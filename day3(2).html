        <p>Jeff Bezos' journey from a small-town boy to one of the world's richest and most influential businessmen is a story of vision, persistence, and innovation. Born in 1964, he displayed an early passion for technology and business, eventually graduating from Princeton University with degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. After working on Wall Street, Bezos took a bold risk in 1994 by founding Amazon as an online bookstore. Despite skepticism, he focused on customer satisfaction, innovation, and long-term growth, gradually expanding Amazon into a global powerhouse in e-commerce, cloud computing, AI, and digital streaming.</p>

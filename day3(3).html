                Spider-Man
            </h1>
            <p>Spider-Man's journey is a fascinating case study in heroism, responsibility, and morality, deeply rooted in storytelling theories like Joseph Campbell's Hero’s Journey and ethical frameworks. From the moment Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider, his life changes dramatically, setting him on a path filled with trials, self-discovery, and moral dilemmas. Unlike many traditional heroes, Spider-Man is not born into greatness but is rather forced to grow into it through personal loss and hard-earned lessons. His transformation is marked by internal conflicts, balancing the pressures of being a teenager with the immense burden of protecting a city that often misunderstands him.
                One of the most profound aspects of Spider-Man’s story is how it reflects deontological ethics—the idea that duty and moral responsibility outweigh personal desires. The tragic loss of Uncle Ben serves as a catalyst, embedding in him the iconic principle: "With great power comes great responsibility." This lesson shapes his decisions, compelling him to use his powers not for personal gain but for the greater good, even at the cost of his own happiness. His struggles against villains like the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom are not just physical battles but ethical dilemmas, forcing him to constantly question the nature of justice, revenge, and forgiveness.
